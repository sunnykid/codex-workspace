# Design Overview

## Purpose
This repository serves as a working directory for codex tasks. The goal of this document is to outline how we capture and communicate lightweight design decisions as the project evolves.

## Principles
- Keep documentation concise and actionable.
- Prefer clarity over completeness.
- Record decisions close to the code they affect.

## Structure
- **Problem statement**: Briefly describe the problem being solved.
- **Constraints**: List key technical or product constraints.
- **Approach**: Summarize the chosen design and trade-offs.
- **Alternatives**: Note options considered and why they were not selected.
- **Follow-ups**: Track open questions or future improvements.

## Maintenance
Update this file when introducing new architectural patterns, major refactors, or non-trivial dependencies.
